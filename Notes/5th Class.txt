**** If esle class
	Shorten operation condition(Single Line)
		a = 6 if 5>5 else 5
		a = 6 if 5>5 else 5 if 4>5 else 10

	Pass Contion in if else
		if contion has no value	
		if 6>6:
			pass
		else:
			print('Hello')

	Modular Operator
		Which gives the remainder


**** Loop ****
python has while loop and for loop
	e.g
	i = 0

	while i < 10:
	    print("Hello World!")
	    i = i + 1

	While true: loop is infinitly run
	incase of inout it stop until givee value
	-- it use when we know how much time it loop

	while True:
		condtion...

	For each loop
		students_mark = {"arjun": 90, "suraj": 80, "prakash":50}

		for key,value in students_mark.items():
		    print(key,value)

		   * pass
		   * continue = it end the condition
		   * break = end the loop
